- 🏫 I am a final year Bachelor's in computer science and engineering student who loves to solve real-life problems. 
- ✏️ This passion goes into the field of content writing as well, like correcting grammar:)
- 💃🏽 My hobbies include reading books, learning languages, drinking coffee, dancing mindlessly, petting animals and listening to lo-fi music!
- ✈️ Being an enthusiastic traveller, I love to travel to new places and experience their diverse culture and food.
- ✨ I am not afraid of trying new things, so I try to manage whatever life throws at me and make the best out of it!
